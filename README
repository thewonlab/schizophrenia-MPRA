##BEFORE RUNNING SCRIPTS

To reproduce our results, there are two options:

- Download FASTQ files and its respective _bcreads.txt file from GEO (...)
- Download DNA/RNA count matrix file from GEO (...)

(#2 is faster and easier)

Now... 

1. Either git clone or download our files and scripts to your local/virtual environment.
2. Modify config_scz.yml file within files/ folder (You only need to modify first two variables). 
  2-1. Modify script_dir: to identify where the scripts/ from github are stored.
  2-2. Modify scz_file_foldername: to identify where the files from GEO are stored. 
  2-3. Modify output_file_dir: to identify the location of the mpra result.
3. Depending on the option that you chose above either run:
  3-1. run generate_mpra_result_from_count_fastq for option 1  
  3-2. run generate_mpra_result_from_count_matrix for option 2
------------------------------------

##RUNNING SCRIPTS

- for option 1:
1. using generate_mpra_result_from_fastq, modify line 11 to identify the location of confiz_scz.yml file
- for option 2:
1. using generate_mpra_result_from_count_matrix, modify line 11 to identify the location of confiz_scz.yml file
